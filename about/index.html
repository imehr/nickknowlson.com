<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p class="last_paragraph">Hi, I'm Nick Knowlson and two things I can't get enough of are programming and reading. I live in Victoria, BC with my fiance Samantha and our cat, Ruby.</p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p class="last_paragraph">I'm a software developer and I love building things. I take pride in the quality of my work and enjoy actively improving my skills. I can write code in many languages, but I am most comfortable in C# and Ruby at the moment. I am gradually learning Haskell, working through the book <i>Seven Languages In Seven Weeks</i> and soon will move on to C and systems-level programming. Check out my <a href="/projects/">Projects page</a> for some of my side projects. </p>

<h2>Do I have any hobbies?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:.5em;">I love reading, whether it is fiction or otherwise. When I read fiction, I mostly read sci-fi &amp; fantasy. I have a large (and growing!) collection of programming books as well. Some of my favourite authors are Neil Gaiman, George R.R. Martin, Isaac Asimov, Neal Stephenson, and Steve McConnell. Take a look at my <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/nickknowlson">Goodreads account</a> for what I'm reading now.</p>
<p class="last_paragraph">I also enjoy playing games of all kinds. Two of my current favourite video games are Starcraft 2 and Minecraft. I also enjoy board games like Carcassonne, Blockus, Go, and Chess, and I have recently started playing tennis. If you have some kind of account on Battle.net, Xbox Live, Steam etc. feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> and we'll play a few games!</p>
