It helps highlight things you're looking for when searching for apartments or housing on craigslist. This script will follow each link on the search page and scan the individual listing's body page for the keywords you enter. When it finds them, it will retrieve them and highlight them as positive or negative.
At the moment, it should turn [this listing page](http://i.imgur.com/z5UVY.jpg) into [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/Lg3E0.jpg), and [this item page](http://i.imgur.com/9zbqA.jpg) into [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/78gq6.jpg).

It makes it easier to narrow attention down to the more interesting ones, but there's still a fair way to go before I'm happy with it.

**Next steps:**

* Set up an easy way to install it. Write instructions.
